Lexical complexity plays a crucial role in reading comprehension. Predicting lexical complexity accurately can enable a system to better guide a user to an appropriate text, or tailor a text to their needs. NLP systems have been developed to simplify texts for second language learners, native speakers with low literacy levels, and people with reading disabilities. 

The dataset provided is an augmented version of CompLex, a multi-domain English dataset with sentences annotated using a 5-point Likert scale (1-5) described in [Shardlow et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07008.pdf). The task is to predict the complexity value of words in context.
